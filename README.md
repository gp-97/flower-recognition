# flower-recognition
Applying Deep-learning to classify flower types.
  The project deploys a simple CNN using keras. The model has been trained on a dataset consisting of flower pictures. These flowers are :- 
    daisy
    dandelion
    rose
    sunflower
    tulip
 The dataset has been obtained from Kaggle.
 The present model delivers about 66% accuracy on a test dataset derived from the original dataset.
 For people wanting to try out the model, a separate 'FlowerClassification-66.24.h5' file has been provided which consists of trained model.
